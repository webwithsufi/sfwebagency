        <h2>The Death of Keyword Stuffing</h2>
        <p>In 2024, Google's algorithms have evolved beyond simple keyword matching. The search engine now uses <strong>Entity-Based Search</strong>, which focuses on relationships between topics rather than just strings of text. If you want to rank, you need to prove you are an authority in your niche.</p>
        
        <h3>The Importance of E-E-A-T</h3>
        <p>Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) are the pillars of modern SEO. At SF Growth, we focus on building these signals through high-quality backlinking and technical site audits. You can explore our <a href="#ai-strategy" class="text-indigo-400 font-bold">AI Strategy Engine</a> to see how we map out authority.</p>
        
        <blockquote>"Search engines don't rank websites; they rank answers."</blockquote>
        
        <h3>3 Steps to Dominate Local Search</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Optimized Google Business Profile:</strong> Ensure your NAP (Name, Address, Phone) data is identical across the web.</li>
          <li><strong>Hyper-Local Content:</strong> Write about events and issues specific to your city to anchor your entity in a geographic location.</li>
          <li><strong>Core Web Vitals:</strong> Google prioritizes sites that load fast and offer a smooth user experience.</li>
        </ol>

      content: `
        <h2>Milliseconds Mean Millions</h2>
        <p>Amazon found that every 100ms of latency cost them 1% in sales. For a small business, a 3-second delay is often the difference between a new customer and a bounce. Our web development philosophy is built on <strong>performance first</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Modern Frameworks Matter</h3>
        <p>Using legacy builders like WordPress with 50+ plugins creates "Code Bloat." We utilize clean, modern stacks (like React and Next.js) to ensure your site is lightning fast out of the box. Our <a href="#services" class="text-indigo-400 font-bold">Web Engineering team</a> specializes in these high-performance architectures.</p>
        
        <h3>The Conversion Funnel</h3>
        <p>A fast site isn't just for SEO; it's for trust. A professional, snappy website tells the customer that your business is competent. When a site lags, the user feels a psychological "friction" that stops them from clicking 'Buy Now'.</p>

        <h2>The Vanity Metric Trap</h2>
        <p>Many agencies will brag about low "Cost Per Click" (CPC). But if those clicks don't convert, they are worthless. At SF, we track the metrics that matter: <strong>ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)</strong> and <strong>CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)</strong>.</p>
        
        <h3>The 'Intent' Advantage</h3>
        <p>Unlike Social Media ads, where you interrupt someone's scrolling, Google Ads catch people while they are actively looking for a solution. This is "High Intent" traffic. The math is simple: target the right intent + high-converting landing page = Profit.</p>
        
        <h3>Scaling Without Breaking</h3>
        <p>When you double your ad budget, you shouldn't expect to double your work. You should expect to double your automation. We use AI-driven bidding strategies to ensure your budget is spent at the peak hours for your industry. Check out our <a href="#ai-strategy" class="text-indigo-400 font-bold">AI Roadmap tool</a> to see your potential scale.</p>
